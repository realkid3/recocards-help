## Can I use 'deliver' button to invite people to contribute?

No, do not do that.

When you use the Deliver button, a link is sent to the recipient, which doesn't allow adding new messages. If you Invite people using the Delivery flow, your invitees will be stuck and won't be able to add any messages.
