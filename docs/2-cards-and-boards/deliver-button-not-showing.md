# 'Deliver' button not showing

> Issue: You created a card or board on [RecoCards.com](https://recocards.com), but the *Deliver* button isn't there.

## 1. Make sure you're signed in.

If you don't sign in, we'll have no way to associate the card ownership with you.

## 2. Open the card in the same browser where you first created it.

If you create a card and are not signed in, we save a temporary token in your browser. Once you sign in, this token is automatially associated with your account.

So, after signining in from the same browser that you created the card with, open the card link there, and it should automatically resolve the issue.

## 3. Reach us

If you still have issues, please reach us at help@recocards.com.
